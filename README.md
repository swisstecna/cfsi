# CFSI - Pubblic Additives Dataset
This database includes most of the Codex Aliments, classified and catalogued in an orderly manner. The data and information contained are taken from official sources such as EFSA or Open Food Fatcs. We take care of taking this information, transcribing it in an orderly and precise way. But we cannot guarantee 100% accuracy, so please take this data in a very indicative way and consult other more updated sources for medical, scientific or generally more important reasons.

## Use the "CFSI" database to:
1. Get a quick idea about the additive.
2. Create your own custom database version.
3. Developing your food app or project.
4. Improve CFSI database and integrity.

## Do not use the "CFSI" database to:
1. Do scientific research.
2. For medical and treatment purposes.
3. For school or university study environments.

Don't rely only on CFSI but always consult other official sources at the same time. CFSI can help you have a clearer and more direct vision.
